## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure & Component Use

- Group files logically according to purpose:

  - `hooks/` for custom hooks
  - `store/` for Zustand stores
  - `api/` or `services/` for API handlers
  - `models/` for Mongoose schemas
  - `components/` for reusable UI elements

- Maintain consistent **structure, naming, and coding style** across all files of the same type.

**Always aim for clean, maintainable, and scalable code.**
Make intelligent decisions based on the project's current architecture and design system.
